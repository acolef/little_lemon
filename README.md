# Little Lemon Capstone Project
## Preface
This is my project submission for the Meta Front-End Developer Capstone course on Coursera. Included is a React application for a fictitious restaurant, Little Lemon, in Chicago, Illinois. As per the requirements, the site currently includes a few completed pages:

1. The homepage
2. An about page
3. A table reservation page

The website's design was inspired by a Figma mock-up of the homepage, which we were tasked with creating, and a simple design document, with which we were provided:

- [Homepage mock-up](https://www.figma.com/design/ugZ4DJawwBa4pEYhoACKbq/canvas?node-id=0-1&t=1Qo05Yzsq3xmAWMN-1)
- [Design document](https://www.figma.com/design/ekIgzNFuWd5TzEOLA8dhv6/Little-Lemon-prototype?node-id=1-142&t=17BLUr9q3bBLOvOP-1)
- [Higher resolution style guide reference](https://github.com/acolef/little_lemon/blob/main/style-guide/PG_LittleLemon_StyleGuide.pdf)

I have tried to stay faithful to both while designing the site, while prioritzing clarity, stylistic consistency, readability, accessibility, and functionality.

During development, I decided to add some additional functionalities which we were not required to implement. I felt that these functionalities were imperative for an operable and responsive website, and creating them presented significant learning opportunities, as well as skill refreshers.

The app has been tested in the Brave browser (Chromium-based) and Mozilla Firefox; however, some rudimentary automated tests (using Jest) are included as well.
